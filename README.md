## Getting Data

I found the data on Insideairbnb.com which is an independent, non-commercial set of tools and data to explore how Airbnb is really being used in cities around the world. An extremely thorough analysis of an NYC Airbnb dataset by Sarang Gupta and team ([link](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)) served as inspiration and guidance.
